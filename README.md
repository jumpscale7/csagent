# CSAgent #
A JumpScale Agent for the JumpScale7 platform, written in Lua.

More information about the concepts behind the project is available on the [project wiki](https://github.com/Jumpscale/csagent/wiki).

## Installation and running ##
Manageable via the the jpackage system:
```bash
jpackage install -n csagent GID
```

Where `GID` is the designated numerical ID of your Grid.

## Manual Execution ##
Having fulfilled the execution dependencies, CSAgent is started from the [`csagent.lua`](https://github.com/Jumpscale/csagent/blob/master/csagent.lua) script and its execution logic can be followed from there and onwards in a fairly straightforward and well-documented manner.
